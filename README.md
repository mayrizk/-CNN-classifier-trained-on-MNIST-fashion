# CNN-classifier-trained-on-MNIST-fashion
we create CNN, learn how works convolution neural networks, how batch normalization and dropout layers improve model results and learn Keras and Tensorflow frameworks. As train data, I chose the fashion-MNIST dataset and model reaches 92.53% accuracy on average

The training set consists of 60k examples and test set consists of 10k examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes as mentioned below.
